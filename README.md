2. I love the tutorials this guy makes and this is a rather complete tutorial that covers nearly a whole game.

3. Adding sounds and music, never done this before and it was challenging. I also had some troubles with animations since I wanted some to freeze while others are still playing (using Time.timeScale = 0f).

4. I learned how to add sounds as well as creating simulated times. I also improved my animation skill

5. I add a bunch of things that the tutorial doesn't cover:
	- Main menu
	- Music
	- Death and main menu animation
	- Resource to collect for the score (acorns)
	- Escape menu and a proper gameover menu
The "options" buttons don't work yet since I had nothing to tweak. Gonna add later at least the possibility to lower music and sound volume separately.

P.S.: I'm going to continue polishing the game after the deadline, last valid commit is entitled "Last commit before deadline".
